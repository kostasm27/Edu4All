                Ms. Rosas, a UN Young Leader, is the founder of El Origen, a foundation that provides at-risk youth with a second chance at education. O-lab, the app developed by El Origen, is adapted for indigenous students, who have some of the world’s lowest education attainment levels.
                <br><br>
                In an interview with UN News, Ms. Rosas expressed her firm belief that inclusive digital education is the solution to bridging many of the world’s economic, social and educational gaps.
                <br><br>
                “It is not enough to give the internet to everyone, you have to create specific tools that are customizable, and their impact must be measurable. We must think in terms of communities when we create technology, and not simply build generic tools, with a community aspect bolted on later.
                <br>
                I was born in La Guajira in 1991, the year in which indigenous people such as the Wayúu, who live in the region, a peninsula shared by Venezuela and Colombia, were officially recognized as Colombian citizens for the first time. Before that, as non-citizens they were only allowed to attend Catholic schools, and were barred from state-run schools. However, La Guajira is still the region with the largest indigenous population in Colombia and also the one with the highest rates of school dropout and illiteracy.
                <br>
                My interest in finding customized solutions to the educational crisis is the result of observing the many shortcomings in this area, such as the marginalization of children and young people from the most vulnerable communities."
                <br><br>
                The project is the result of my life and experiences. I come from a family of educators. My grandmother, who was of African descent, had a school in her house, to help indigenous and non-indigenous children who had trouble adjusting to the regular school system. Since I was little, I have been very interested in finding solutions to problems with the education system.
                <br><br>
                Coming from a family which is descended from Africans, I had more opportunities than indigenous people. During my time at school, I remember that the indigenous people wanted a new, inclusive form of education. When I was in fifth grade, a lot of kids from different communities were just entering. They were the same age as me but they were starting school for the first time, so they weren’t able to adapt to the system, and usually dropped out. Today, this is still happening.
